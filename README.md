# CC0-1.0 Music

A collection of public-domain/CC0-1.0-licensed  music from scattered locations across the internet. Currently it contains roughly ~7000 songs and is ~40gb worth of music.

---

## Backstory
I created this repository out of a personal need for a music dataset to aid my own procedural music analysis/research and published it to give back to the community.

## Purpose
This repo aims to provide a valuable dataset for individuals interested or curious in procedural music analysis. Such as academic researchers, digital signal proccessor experimentors and ethical audio driven ML efforts.

I hope it can enable more musical-researchers to be able to share meaningful results without infringing on the copyrights of musicians.

## DataSet Notes
1. The music is grouped based on the websites that originally aggregated the audio.
2. No normalization to the data has been applied, so expect various file formats, sample rates, etc...
3. Dataset aims to *only* include music in the dataset not misc audio files. Still, there are likely some files that do not resemble "music" at least in the traditional sense.
4. Files over 100mb are omitted in order to avoid GIT-LFS headaches.

## Note to Users
This repo was created to aid the community, so if you're able to use it in your research/practice then we'd love to hear about it. Please let us know in the community-showcase GitHub thread!

## Contributions
All contributions are welcome. Repo is open to publish/promote deriviative research and/or add additional public-domain music. Either PR something in and/or start a GitHub Issue related to your contribution.

## Takedown Requests
